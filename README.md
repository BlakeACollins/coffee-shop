# Regular Joe Coffee Shop

I made a simple E-commerce site for Regualr Joe Coffee Shop. This site is made with React, CSS, Bootstrap, Gatsby, Graphql, Contenful, Snipcart, Formspree, and hosted on Netlify. 

STILL IN PRODUCTION

Project is broken. Gatsby Image doesn't work on Netilfy and adding Contentful to Gatsby doesn't work either. Reached out to the instructor three weeks ago, havn't heard anything back. Will try to troubleshoot but most likey delete this project. 

Adding data to Contentful 2/4/2020
